## Description

For this module, we were tasked with building the backend of a fictional social media site which had thoughts rather than tweets. Using NoSQL rather than SQL, we created schemas and CRUD routes in a different yet similar fashion to what we had learned so far. This module was an exercise in actually reading the README properly, as I made extra work for myself that was thoroughly unnecessary.

## Installation

For starters, run npm i to install all the necessary files with "mongoose" and "express". There is a seed file that preloads users that can be run with npm run seed, then you must npm run start to make the link live.

## Usage

All of the magic happens in Insomnia, where we can get all users, get a single user; create and delete users and well as add and remove friends. You can also see all thoughts, see a single thought; create, update, and delete thoughts as well as create and delete reactions. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NDShfRSreslHzSlv4FZikx31HzcUyZlQ/view 

## Credits

Shoutout to our instructor and TA, for showing me that I was working too hard and inventing issues that didn't need to a thing.
